"You see five mysterious numbers beside the door. To enter, you must figure out their secret pattern. Use mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, %) to calculate their average. Only then will you understand their true meaning."

This way, users will naturally apply arithmetic operators to find the average:

average
=
num1
+
num2
+
num3
+
num4
+
num5
5
average= 
5
num1+num2+num3+num4+num5
â€‹
 
Once they find the correct average, they can move forward. You can also introduce comparison operators:

"If the average is greater than 10, the door creaks open..."
"If the average is less than 10, the room stays locked..."
